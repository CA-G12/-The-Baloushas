- JavaScript ➙ It is used to gives the app interactive elements that engage a user
- API ➙ It used for communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented
- express ➙ primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind
